                                Many people think that hemp is the same is marijuana this is not true.
                                Both hemp and marijuana are varieties of the cannabis sativa, but hemp contains les THC (the psychoactive substance in marijuana).
                                This makes hemp unusable as recreational product.

                                After the hemp is harvested the stems are getting soaked in water for about 10 days.
                                The next step is called breaking.
                                Breaking is a process where you latterly break the stems into long fibers.
                                This is done by machines nowadays.
                                These fibers are further processed into pulp and after that yarn.
                                The yarn is the base for the new fabric.
